- Data wrangling and subsetting
  - Changing data types
  - Creating new dataframes
- Data consistency checks
  - Fixed mixed-type variables
  - Found and dealt with missing values
  - Found and removed duplicates
- Derived new variables
  - Created a new column that added the state to the location so I could create a choropleth in Tableau.
  - Created another column, review_activity_ratio, to help uncover the most active areas.
- Grouped and aggregated data
  - Created new flags to assist with analysis
  - Created summary columns of descriptive statistics using the groupby() function
- Used data visualization in Python
  - Created histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots
### Utilized Tableau for additional visualizations
